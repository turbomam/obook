<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>This tutorial introduces the tutee to many of the more advanced features of the Web Ontology Language (OWL). The topic of family history is used to take the tutee through various modelling issues and, in doing so, using many features of OWL 2 to build a Family History Knowledge Base (FHKB). The exercises are designed to maximise inference about family history through the use of an automated reasoner on an OWL knowledge base (KB) containing many members of the Stevens family.</p>
<p>The aim, therefore, is to enable people to learn advanced features of OWL 2 in a setting that involves both classes and individuals, while attempting to maximise the use of inference within the FHKB.</p>
<h3 id="11-learning-outcomes">1.1 Learning Outcomes<a class="headerlink" href="#11-learning-outcomes" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>By doing this tutorial, a tutee should be able to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Know about the separation of entities into TBox and ABox;</li>
<li>Use classes and individuals in modelling;</li>
<li>Write fancy class expressions;</li>
<li>Assert facts about individuals;</li>
<li>Use the effects of property hierarchies, property characteristics, domain/range constraints to drive
   inference;</li>
<li>Use constraints and role chains on inferences about individuals;</li>
<li>Understand and manage the consequences of the open world assumption in the TBox and ABox;</li>
<li>Use nominals in class expressions;</li>
<li>Appreciate some limits of OWL 2.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="12-why-family-history">1.2 Why Family History?<a class="headerlink" href="#12-why-family-history" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Building an FHKB enables us to meet our learning outcomes through a topic that is accessible to virtually everyone. Family history or genealogy is a good topic for a general tutorial on OWL 2 as it enables us to touch many features of the language and, importantly, it is a field that everyone knows. All people have a family and therefore a family history – even if they do not know their particular family history. A small caveat was put on the topic being accessible to everyone as some cultures differ, for instance, in the description of cousins and labels given to different siblings. Nevertheless, family history remains a topic that everyone can talk about.</p>
<p>Family history is a good topic for an OWL ontology as it obviously involves both individuals – the people involved – and classes of individuals – people, men and women, cousins, etc. Also, it is an area rich in inference; from only knowing parentage and sex of an individual, it is possible to work out all family relationships – for example, sharing parents implies a sibling relationship; one’s parent’s brothers are one’s uncles; one’s parent’s parents are one’s grandparents. So, we should be able to construct an ontology that allows us to both express family history, but also to infer family relationships between people from knowing relatively little about them.</p>
<p>As we will learn through the tutorial, OWL 2 cannot actually do all that is needed to create a FHKB. This is unfortunate, but we use it to our advantage to illustrate some of the limitations of OWL 2. We know that rule based systems can do family history with ease, but that is not the point here; we are not advocating OWL DL as an appropriate mechanism for doing family history, but we do use it as a good educational example.</p>
<p>We make the following assumptions about what people know:</p>
<ul>
<li>We assume that people know OWL to the level that is known at the end of the <a href="http://owl.cs.manchester.ac.uk/publications/talks-and-tutorials/protg-owl-tutorial/">Pizza tutorial</a>.
  Some ground will be covered again, but a lot of basic OWL is assumed.</li>
<li>We assume people know how to use Protégé or their OWL environment of choice. We do not give
  ‘click by click’ instructions. At some places, some guidance is given, but this is not to be relied
  upon as Protégé changes and we will not keep up to date.</li>
</ul>
<p>We make some simplifying assumptions in this tutorial:</p>
<ul>
<li>We take a conventional western view of family history. This appears to have most effects on naming
  of sibling and cousin relationships.</li>
<li>We take a straight-forward view on the sex of people; this is explored further in Chapter 4;</li>
<li>A ‘conventional’ view of marriage is taken; this is explored further in Chapter 9.</li>
<li>We make no special treatment of time or dates; we are only interested in years and we do not do
  anything fancy; this is explored more in Chapter 7.</li>
<li>We assume the ancestors of people go back for ever; obviously this is not true, eventually one would
  get back to a primordial soup and one’s ancestors are not humans (members of the classPerson),
  but we don’t bother with such niceties.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the tutorial, you should be able to produce a property hierarchy and a TBox or class hierarchy such as shown in Figure 1.1; all supported by use of the automated reasoner and a lot of OWL 2’s features.</p>

<p>Here are some tips on using this manual to the best advantage:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start at the beginning and work towards the end.</li>
<li>You can just read the tutorial, but building the FHKB will help you learn much more and much
  more easily</li>
<li>Use the reasoner in each task; a lot of the FHKB tutorial is about using the reasoner and not doing
  so will detract from the learning outcomes.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="15-conventions-used-in-this-tutorial">1.5 Conventions used in this Tutorial<a class="headerlink" href="#15-conventions-used-in-this-tutorial" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>All OWL is written in Manchester Syntax.</li>
<li>When we use FHKB entities within text, we use a sans serif typeface.</li>
<li>We use CamelCase for classes and property names.</li>
<li>Class names start with upper case.</li>
<li>Individual names start with a lower case letter and internal underscores to break words.</li>
<li>Property names usually start with ‘is’ or ‘has’ and are CamelCase with a lower case initial letter.</li>
<li>Many classes and individuals in the FHKB have annotation properties, usually human readable labels. They show up in some of the examples in Manchester syntax, but are not made explicit as part of the tasks in this tutorial.</li>
<li>Every object property is necessarily a sub-property of topObjectProperty. It does not have to be asserted as such. Nevertheless, there might be situations where this relationship is made explicit in this tutorial for illustrative reasons.</li>
<li>The individuals we are dealing with represent distinct persons. Throughout the tutorial, once the respective axiom is introduced (chapter 7.1.1), the reader should make sure that all his or her individuals are always made distinct, especially when he or she adds a new one.</li>
<li>At the end of each chapter, we note the Description Logic Language (expressivity) needed to represent the ontology and the reasoning times for a number of state of the art reasoning systems. This should get the reader a sense how difficult the FHKB becomes for reasoners to deal with over time.</li>
<li>When there is some scary OWL or the reasoner may find the FHKB hard work, you will see a ‘here
  be dragons’ image.<sup>1</sup> <img alt="dragon" src="../../images/FHKB%20figures/dragon.png" /></li>

<h2 id="adding-some-individuals-to-the-fhkb">Adding some Individuals to the FHKB<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-some-individuals-to-the-fhkb" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>In this chapter we will start by creating a fresh OWL ontology and adding some individuals that will be
surrogates for people in the FHKB. In particular you will:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new OWL ontology for the FHKB;</li>
<li>Add some individuals that will stand for members of the Stevens family.</li>
<li>Describe parentage of people.</li>
<li>Add some facts to specific individuals as to their parentage;</li>
<li>See the reasoner doing some work.</li>
<li>At the moment we will ignore sex; sex will not happen until Chapter 4.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="21-a-world-of-objects">2.1 A World of Objects<a class="headerlink" href="#21-a-world-of-objects" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The ‘world’<sup>2</sup> or field of interest we model in an ontology is made up of objects or individuals. Such objects include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>People, their pets, the pizzas they eat;</li>
<li>The processes of cooking pizzas, living, running, jumping, undertaking a journey;</li>
<li>The spaces within a room, a bowl, an artery;</li>
<li>The attributes of things such as colour, dimensions, speed, shape of various objects;</li>
<li>Boundaries, love, ideas, plans, hypotheses.</li>
</ul>
<p><sup>2</sup> we use ‘world’ as a synonym of ‘field of interest’ or ‘domain’. ‘World’ does not restrict us to modelling the physical world outside our consciousness.</p>
<p>We observe these objects, either outside lying around in the world or in our heads. OWL is all about modelling such individuals. Whenever we make a statement in OWL, when we write down an axiom, we are making statements about individuals. When thinking about the axioms in an ontology it is best to think about the individuals involved, even if OWL individuals do not actually appear in the ontology.

<p>Biologically, everyone has parents; a mother and a father<sup>3</sup>. The starting point for family history is parentage; we need to relate the family member objects by object properties. An object property relates two objects, in this case a child object with his or her mother or father object. To do this we need to create three object properties:</p>

<p>You should find the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>David Bright (1934) is the father of Robert David Bright (1965) and Richard John Bright (1962).</li>
<li>Robert David Bright (1965) has David Bright 1934 as a parent.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since we have said that <code>isFatherOf</code> has an inverse of <code>hasFather</code>, and we have asserted that <code>Robert_David_Bright_1965 hasFather David_Bright_1934</code>, we have a simple entailment that <code>David_Bright_1934 isFatherOf Robert_David_Bright_1965</code>. So, without asserting the <code>isFatherOf</code> facts, we have been able to ask and get answers for that DL query.</p>
<p>As we asserted that <code>Robert_David_Bright_1965 hasFather David_Bright_1934</code>, we also infer that he <code>hasParent</code> <code>David_Bright_1934</code>; this is because <code>hasParent</code> is the super-property of <code>hasFather</code> and the sub-property implies the super-property. This works all the way up the property tree until <code>topObjectProperty</code>, so all individuals are related by <code>topObjectProperty</code>—this is always true. This implication ‘upwards’ is the way to interpret how the property hierarchies work.</p>
<h3 id="23-summary">2.3 Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#23-summary" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>We have now covered the basics of dealing with individuals in OWL ontologies. We have set up some properties, but without domains, ranges, appropriate characteristics and then arranged them in a hierarchy. From only a few assertions in our FHKB, we can already infer many facts about an individual: Simple exploitation of inverses of properties and super-properties of the asserted properties.</p>
<p>We have also encountered some important principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>We get inverses for free.</li>
<li>The sub-property implies the super-property. So, <code>hasFather</code> implies the <code>hasParent</code> fact between individuals. This entailment of the super-property is very important and will drive much of the inference we do with the FHKB.</li>
<li>Upon reasoning we get the inverses of properties between named individuals for free.</li>
<li>Lots is still open. For example, we do not know the sex of individuals and what other children, other than those described, people in the FHKB may have.</li>

<h2 id="31-ancestors-and-descendants">3.1 Ancestors and Descendants<a class="headerlink" href="#31-ancestors-and-descendants" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The FHKB has parents established between individuals and we know that all people have two parents. A parent is an ancestor of its children; a person’s parent’s parents are its ancestors; and so on. So, in our FHKB, Robert’s ancestors are David, Margaret, William, Iris, Charles, Violet, James, another Violet, another William, Sarah and so on. If my parent’s parents are my ancestors, then what we need is a transitive version of the <code>hasParent</code> property. Obviously we do not want <code>hasParent</code> to be transitive, as Robert’s grandparents (and so on) would become his parents (and that would be wrong).</p>
<p>We can easily achieve what is necessary. We need a <code>hasAncestor</code> property that has a transitive characteristic. The trick is to make this a super-property of the <code>hasParent</code> property. As explained before, a sub-property implies its super-property. So, if individual <em>x</em> holds a <code>hasParent</code> property with an individual <em>y</em> , then it also holds an instance of its super-property <code>hasAncestor</code> with the individual <em>y</em>. If individual <em>y</em> then holds a <code>hasParent</code> property with another individual <em>z</em> , then there is also, by implication, a <code>hasAncestor</code> property between <em>y</em> and <em>z</em>. As <code>hasAncestor</code> is transitive, <em>x</em> and <em>z</em> also hold a <code>hasAncestor</code> relationship between them.</p>
<p>The inverse of <code>hasAncestor</code> can either be <code>isAncestorOf</code> or <code>hasDescendant</code>. We choose the <code>isAncestorOf</code> option.</p>

<p>The <code>hasAncestor</code> object property will look like this:</p>
<pre><code>ObjectProperty: hasAncestor
SubPropertyOf: hasRelation
SuperPropertyOf: hasParent,
Characteristics: Transitive

</code></pre>
<p>As usual, it is best to think of the objects or individuals involved in the relationships. Consider the three individuals – Robert, David and William. Each has a <code>hasFather</code> property, linking Robert to David and then David to William. As <code>hasFather</code> implies its super-property <code>hasParent</code>, Robert also has a <code>hasParent</code> property with David, and David has a <code>hasParent</code> relation to William. Similarly, as <code>hasParent</code> implies <code>hasAncestor</code>, the Robert object has a <code>hasAncestor</code> relation to the David object and the David object has one to the William object. As <code>hasAncestor</code> is transitive, Robert not only holds this property to the David object, but also to the William object (and so on back through Robert’s ancestors).</p>
<h3 id="32-grandparents-and-great-grandparents">3.2 Grandparents and Great Grandparents<a class="headerlink" href="#32-grandparents-and-great-grandparents" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>We also want to use a sort of restricted transitivity in order to infer grandparents, great grandparents and so on. My grandparents are my parent’s parents; my grandfathers are my parent’s fathers. My great grandparents are my parent’s parent’s parents. My great grandmothers are my parent’s parent’s mothers. This is sort of like transitivity, but we want to make the paths only a certain length and, in the case of grandfathers, we want to move along two relationships – <code>hasParent</code> and then <code>hasFather</code>.</p>
<p>We can do this with OWL 2’s sub-property chains. The way to think about sub-property chains is: If we
see property <em>x</em> followed by property <em>y</em> linking three objects, then it implies that property <em>z</em> is held between</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 3.1" src="../../images/FHKB%20figures/grandparent.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 3.1:</strong> Three blobs representing objects of the classPerson. The three objects are linked by a <code>hasParent</code>
property and this implies a <code>hasGrandparent</code> property.</p>
<p>the first and third objects. Figure 3.1 shows this diagrammatically for the <code>hasGrandfather</code> property.</p>
<p>For various grandparent object properties we need the following sets of implications:</p>
<ul>
<li>My parent’s parents are my grandparents;</li>
<li>My parent’s fathers are my grandfathers;</li>
<li>My parent’s mothers are my grandmothers;</li>
<li>My parent’s parent’s parents are my great grandparents or my grandparent’s parents are my great
  grandparents.</li>
<li>My parent’s parent’s fathers are my great grandfathers or my parent’s grandfathers are my great
  grandfathers;</li>
<li>My parent’s parent’s mothers are my great grandmothers (and so on).</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that we can trace the paths in several ways, some have more steps than others, though the shorter
paths themselves employ paths. Tracing these paths is what OWL 2’s sub-property chains achieve. For
the new object property <code>hasGrandparent</code> we write:</p>
<pre><code>ObjectProperty: hasGrandparent SubPropertyChain: hasParent o hasParent
</code></pre>
<p>We read this as ‘<code>hasParent</code> followed by <code>hasParent</code> implies <code>hasGrandparent</code>’. We also need to think where the <code>hasGrandparent</code> property fits in our growing hierarchy of object properties. Think about the implications: Does holding a <code>hasParent</code> property between two objects imply that they also hold a <code>hasGrandparent</code> property? Of course the answer is ‘no’. So, this new property is not a super-property of <code>hasParent</code>. Does the holding of a <code>hasGrandparent</code> property between two objects imply that they also hold an <code>hasAncestor</code> property? The answer is ‘yes’; so that should be a super-property of <code>hasGrandparent</code>. We need to ask such questions of our existing properties to work out where we put it in the object property hierarchy. At the moment, our <code>hasGrandparent</code> property will look like this:</p>
<pre><code>ObjectProperty: hasGrandParent
SubPropertyOf: hasAncestor
SubPropertyChain: hasParent o hasParent
SuperPropertyOf: hasGrandmother, hasGrandfather
InverseOf: isGrandParentOf
</code></pre>
<p>Do the following task:</p>
<table>
<thead>

<td><ol><li>Make the <code>hasGrandparent</code>, <code>hasGrandmother</code> and <code>hasGrandfather</code> object properties and the obvious inverses (see OWL code above); </li><li> Go to the individuals tabs and inspects the inferred object property assertions for <code>Robert_David_Bright_1965</code> and his parents.</li></ol></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Again, think of the objects involved. We can take the same three objects as before: Robert, David and William. Think about the properties that exist, both by assertion and implication, between these objects. We have asserted only <code>hasFather</code> between these objects. The inverse can be inferred between the actual individuals (remember that this is not the case for class level restrictions – that all instances of a class hold a property does not mean that the filler objects at the other end hold the inverse; the quantification on the restriction tells us this). Remember that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Robert holds a <code>hasFather</code> property with David;</li>
<li>David holds a <code>hasFather</code> property with William;</li>
<li>By implication through the <code>hasParent</code> super-property of <code>hasFather</code>, Robert holds a <code>hasParent</code> property with David, and the latter holds one with William;</li>
<li>The sub-property chain on <code>hasGrandfather</code> then implies that Robert holds a <code>hasGrandfather</code> property to William. Use the diagram in figure 3.1 to trace the path; there is a <code>hasParent</code> path from Robert to William via David and this implies the <code>hasGrandfather</code> property between Robert and William.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is also useful to point out that the inverse of <code>hasGrandfather</code> also has the implication of the sub-property chain of the inverses of <code>hasParent</code>. That is, three objects linked by a path of two <code>isParentOf</code> properties implies that an <code>isGrandfatherOf</code> property is established between the first and third object, in
this case William and Robert. As the inverses of <code>hasFather</code> are established by the reasoner, all the inverse implications also hold.</p>
<h3 id="33-summary">3.3 Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#33-summary" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>It is important when dealing with property hierarchies to think in terms of properties between objects and of the implications ‘up the hierarchy’. A sub-property implies its super-property. So, in our FHKB, two person objects holding a <code>hasParent</code> property between them, by implication also hold an <code>hasAncestor</code>
property between them. In turn, <code>hasAncestor</code> has a super-property <code>hasRelation</code> and the two objects in
question also hold, by implication, this property between them as well.</p>
<p>We made <code>hasAncestor</code> transitive. This means that my ancestor’s ancestors are also my ancestors. That a sub-property is transitive does not imply that its super-property is transitive. We have seen that by manipulating the property hierarchy we can generate a lot of inferences without adding any more facts to the individuals in the FHKB. This will be a feature of the whole process – keep the work to the minimum (well, almost).</p>
<p>In OWL 2, we can also trace ‘paths’ around objects. Again, think of the objects involved in the path of properties that link objects together. We have done simple paths so far – Robert linked to David via <code>hasParent</code> and David linked to William via <code>hasFather</code> implies the link between Robert and William of <code>hasGrandfather</code>. If this is true for all cases (for which you have to use your domain knowledge), one can capture this implication in the property hierarchy. Again, we are making our work easier by adding no new explicit facts, but making use of the implication that the reasoner works out for us.</p>

<li>The sex of each of those people;</li>

<p>We use <code>DomainEntity</code> as a house-keeping measure. All of our ontology goes underneath this class. We can put other classes ‘outside’ the ontology, as siblings of <code>DomainEntity</code>, such as ‘probe’ classes we wish to use to test our ontology.</p>
<p>The main thing to remember about the <code>Person</code> class is that we are using it to represent all ‘people’ individuals. When we make statements about the <code>Person</code> class, we are making statements about all ‘people’ individuals.</p>
<p>What do we know about people? All members of the <code>Person</code> class have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sex – they are either male or female;</li>
<li>Everyone has a birth year;</li>
<li>Everyone has a mother and a father.</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s a lot more we know about people, but we will not mention it here.</p>
<h3 id="42-describing-sex-in-the-fhkb">4.2 Describing Sex in the FHKB<a class="headerlink" href="#42-describing-sex-in-the-fhkb" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Each and every person object has a sex. In the FHKB we will take a simple view on sex – a person is either male or female, with no intersex or administrative sex and so on. Each person only has one sex.</p>
<p>We have two straight-forward options for modelling sex:</p>
<ol>
<li>Each person object has their own sex object, which is either male or female. Thus Robert’s maleness is different from David’s maleness.</li>
<li>There is only one Maleness object and one Femaleness object and each person object has a relationship to either one of these sex objects, but not both.</li>
</ol>
<p>We will take the approach of having a class of Maleness objects and a class of Femaleness objects. These are qualities or attributes of self-standing objects such as a person. These two classes are disjoint, and each is a subclass of a class called <code>Sex</code>. The disjointness means that any one instance of <code>Sex</code> cannot be both an instance of <code>Maleness</code> and an instance of <code>Femaleness</code> at once. We also want to put in a covering axiom on the class <code>Sex</code>, which means that any instance of <code>Sex</code> must be either <code>Maleness</code> or <code>Femaleness</code>; there is no other kind of <code>Sex</code>.</p>
<p><img alt="dragon" src="../../images/FHKB%20figures/dragon.png" /></p>
<p>Again, notice that we have been thinking at the level of objects. We do the same when thinking about <code>Person</code> and their <code>Sex</code>. Each and every person is related to an instance of <code>Sex</code>. Each <code>Person</code> holds one relationship to a <code>Sex</code> object. To do this we create an object property called <code>hasSex</code>. We make this property functional, which means that any object can hold that property to only one distinct filler object.</p>
<p>We make the domain of <code>hasSex</code> to be <code>Person</code> and the range to be <code>Sex</code>. The domain of <code>Person</code> means that any object holding that property will be inferred to be a member of the class <code>Person</code>. Putting the range of <code>Sex</code> on the <code>hasSex</code> property means that any object at the right-hand end of the <code>hasSex</code> property will be inferred to be of the class <code>Sex</code>. Again, think at the level of individuals or objects.</p>
<p>We now put a restriction on the <code>Person</code> class to state that each and every instance of the class <code>Person</code> holds a <code>hasSex</code> property with an instance of the <code>Sex</code> class. It has an existential operator ‘some’ in the axiom, but the functional characteristic means that each <code>Person</code> object will hold only one <code>hasSex</code> property to a distinct instance of a <code>Sex</code> object<sup>4</sup>.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup> An individual could hold two <code>hasSex</code> properties, as long as the sex objects at the right-hand end of the property are not
different.</p>

<p>We now have some of the foundations for the FHKB. We have the concept of <code>Person</code>, but we also need to have the concepts of <code>Man</code> and <code>Woman</code>. Now we have <code>Person</code>, together with <code>Maleness</code> and <code>Femaleness</code>, we have the necessary components to define <code>Man</code> and <code>Woman</code>. These two classes can be defined as: Any <code>Person</code> object that has a male sex can be recognised to be a man; any <code>Person</code> object that has a female sex can be recognised as a member of the class woman. Again, think about what conditions are <em>sufficient</em> for an object to be <em>recognised</em> to be a member of a class; this is how we create defined classes through the use of OWL equivalence axioms.</p>

<p>The <code>Man</code> and <code>Woman</code> classes will be important for use as domain and range constraints on many of the properties used in the FHKB.

<p>The (inferred) property hierarchy in the FHKB should look like that shown in Figure 4.1. Notice that we have asserted the sub-property axioms on one side of the property hierarchy. Having done so, the reasoner uses those axioms, together with the inverses, to work out the property hierarchy for the ‘other side’.</p>
<p>We make <code>hasMother</code> functional, as any one person object can hold only one <code>hasMother</code> property to a distinct <code>Woman</code> object. The range of <code>hasMother</code> is <code>Woman</code>, as a mother has to be a woman. The <code>Person</code> object holding the <code>hasMother</code> property can be either a man or a woman, so we have the domain constraint as <code>Person</code>; this means any object holding a <code>hasMother</code> property will be inferred to be a <code>Person</code>. Similarly, any object at the right-hand end of a <code>hasMother</code> property will be inferred to be a <code>Woman</code>, which is the result we need. The same reasoning goes for <code>hasFather</code> and <code>hasParent</code>, with the sex constraints on the latter being only <code>Person</code>. The inverses of the two functional sub-properties of <code>hasParent</code> are not themselves functional. After all, a <code>Woman</code> can be the mother of many <code>Person</code> objects, but each <code>Person</code> object can have only one mother.</p>

<p>The domain and range constraints on our properties have also driven some entailments. We have not asserted that <code>David_Bright_1934</code> is a member of <code>Man</code>, but the range constraint on <code>hasFather</code> (or the inferred domain constraint on the <code>isFatherOf</code> relation) has enabled this inference to be made. This goes for any individual that is the right-hand-side (either inferred or asserted) of either <code>hasFather</code> or <code>hasMother</code> (where the range is that of <code>Woman</code>). For Robert David Bright, however, he is only the left-hand-side of an <code>hasFather</code> or an <code>hasMother</code> property, so we’ve only entailed that this individual is a member of <code>Person</code>.</p>

<p>In our description of the <code>Person</code> class we have said that each and every instance of the class <code>Person</code> has a father (the same goes for mothers). So, when we ask the query ‘which individuals have a father’, we get all the instances of <code>Person</code> back, even though we have said nothing about the specific parentage of each <code>Person</code>. We do not know who their mothers and fathers are, but we know that they have one of each. We know all the individuals so far entered are members of the <code>Person</code> class; when asserting the type to be either <code>Man</code> or <code>Woman</code> (each of which is a subclass of <code>Person</code>), we infer that each is a person. When asserting the type of each individual via the <code>hasSex</code> property, we know each is a <code>Person</code>, as the domain of <code>hasSex</code> is the <code>Person</code> class. As we have also given the right-hand side of <code>hasSex</code> as either <code>Maleness</code> or <code>Femaleness</code>, we have given sufficient information to recognise each of these <code>Person</code> instances to be members of either <code>Man</code> or <code>Woman</code>.</p>

<p>So far we have not systematically added domains and ranges to the properties in the FHKB. As a reminder, when a property has a domain of <code>X</code> any object holding that property will be inferred to be a member of class <code>X</code>. A domain doesn’t add a constraint that only members of class <code>X</code> hold that property; it is a strong implication of class membership. Similarly, a property holding a range implies that an object acting as right-hand-side to a property will be inferred to be of that class. We have already seen above that we can use domains and ranges to imply the sex of people within the FHKB.</p>

<pre><code>Protégé for example in its current version (November 2015) does not visualise
inherited domains and ranges in the same way as it shows inferred inverse relations.
</code></pre>
<p>We typically assert more domains and ranges than strictly necessary. For example, if we say that <code>hasParent</code> has the domain <code>Person</code>, this means that every object <code>x</code> that is connected to another object <code>y</code> via the <code>hasParent</code> relation must be a <code>Person</code>. Let us assume the only thing we said about <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> is that they are connected by a <code>hasMother</code> relation. Since this implies that <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are also connected by a <code>hasParent</code> relation (<code>hasMother</code> is a sub-property of <code>hasParent</code>) we do <em>not</em> have to assert that <code>hasFather</code> has the domain of <code>Person</code>; it is implied by what we know about the domain and range of <code>hasParent</code>.</p>
<p>In order to remove as many assertions as possible, we may therefore choose to assert as much as we know starting from the top of the hierarchy, and only ever adding a domain if we want to constrain the already inferred domain even further (or range respectively). For example, in our case, we could have chosen to assert <code>Person</code> to be the domain of <code>hasRelation</code>. Since <code>hasRelation</code> is symmetric, it will also infer <code>Person</code> to be the range. We do not need to say anything for <code>hasAncestor</code> or <code>hasParent</code>, and only if we want to constrain the domain or range further (like in the case of <code>hasFather</code> by making the range <code>Man</code>) do we need to actually assert something. It is worth noting that because we have built the object property hierarchy from the bottom (<code>hasMother</code> etc.) we have ended up asserting more than necessary.</p>

<p>After asserting the first fact it should be reported by the reasoner that the ontology is <em>inconsistent</em>. This means, in lay terms, that the model you’ve provided in the ontology cannot accommodate the facts you’ve provided in the fact assertions in your ABox—that is, there is an inconsistency between the facts and the ontology... The ontology is inconsistent because <code>David_Bright_1934</code> is being inferred to be a <code>Man</code> and a <code>Woman</code> at the same time which is inconsistent with what we have said in the FHKB.</p>
<p>When we, however, say that <code>Robert David Bright</code> has two different mothers, nothing bad happens! Our domain knowledge says that the two women are different, but the reasoner does not know this as yet... ; Iris Ellen Archer and Margaret Grace Rever may be the same person; we have to tell the reasoner that they are different. For the same reason the functional characteristic also has no effect until the reasoner ‘knows’ that the individuals are different. We will do this in <a href="#data-properties-in-the-fhkb">Section 7.1.1</a> and live with this ‘fault’ for the moment.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>The TBox after reasoning can be seen in Figure 4.3. Notice that the reasoner has inferred that several of the classes are equivalent or ‘the same’. These are: <code>Descendant</code> and <code>Person</code>; <code>MaleDescendant</code> and <code>Man</code>, <code>FemaleDescendant</code> and <code>Woman</code>.</p>
<p>The reasoner has used the axioms within the ontology to infer that all the instances of <code>Person</code> are also instances of the class <code>Descendant</code> and that all the instances of <code>Woman</code> are also the same instances as the class <code>Female Descendant</code>. This is intuitively true; all people are descendants – they all have parents that have parents etc. and thus everyone is a descendant. All women are female people that have parents etc. As usual we should think about the objects within the classes and what we know about them. This time it is useful to think about the statements we have made about <code>Person</code> in this Chapter – that all instances of <code>Person</code> have a father and a mother; add to this the information from the property hierarchy and we know that all instances of <code>Person</code> have parents and ancestors. We have repeated all of this in our new defined classes for <code>Ancestor</code> and <code>Descendant</code> and the reasoner has highlighted this information.</p>

<p>Most of what we have done in this chapter is straight-forward OWL, all of which would have been met in the pizza tutorial. It is, however, a useful revision and it sets the stage for refining the FHKB. Figure 4.2 shows the basic set-up we have in the FHKB in terms of classes; we have a class to represent person, man and woman, all set-up with a description of sex, maleness and femaleness. It is important to note, however, the approach we have taken: We have always thought in terms of the objects we are modelling.</p>
<p>Here are some things that should now be understood upon completing this chapter:</p>
<ol>
<li>Restrictions on a class in our TBox mean we know stuff about individuals that are members of that class, even though we have asserted no facts on those individuals. We have said, for instance, that all members of the class <code>Person</code> have a mother, so any individual asserted to be a <code>Person</code> must have a mother. We do not necessarily know who they are, but we know they have one.</li>
<li>Some precision is missing – we only know Robert David Bright is a <code>Person</code>, not that he is a <code>Man</code>. This is because, so far, he only has the domain constraint of <code>hasMother</code> and <code>hasFather</code> to help out.</li>
<li>We can cause the ontology to be inconsistent, for example by providing facts that cannot be accommodated by the model of our ontology. In the example, David Bright was inferred to be a member of two disjoint classes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, we looked at some defined classes. We inferred equivalence between some classes where the extents of the classes were inferred to be the same – in this case the extents of <code>Person</code> and <code>Descendant</code> are the same. That is, all the objects that can appear in <code>Person</code> will also be members of <code>Descendant</code>. We can check this implication intuitively – all people are descendants of someone. Perhaps not the most profound inference of all time, but we did no real work to place this observation in the FHKB.</p>
<p><img src="../images/FHKB%20figures/images/NoteIconSmall.png" alt="note" width="50"/></p>
<pre><code>This last point is a good general observation. We can make the reasoner do work
for us. The less maintenance we have to do in the FHKB the better. This will be

<p>Does a blood relation of Robert have the same relationship to Robert (symmetry)? Is a blood relation of Robert’s blood relation a blood relation of Robert (transitivity)? Think of an aunt by marriage; her children are my cousins and blood relations via my uncle, but my aunt is not my blood relation. My siblings share parents; male siblings are brothers and female siblings are sisters. So far we have asserted parentage facts for the <code>Person</code> in our ABox. Remember that our parentage properties have inverses, so if we have added an <code>hasFather</code> property between a <code>Person</code> and a <code>Man</code>, we infer the <code>isFatherOf</code> property between that <code>Man</code> and that <code>Person</code>.</p>
<h3 id="52-siblings-option-one">5.2 Siblings: Option One<a class="headerlink" href="#52-siblings-option-one" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>We should have enough information within the FHKB to infer siblings. We could use a sub-property chain such as:</p>
<pre><code>ObjectProperty: hasSibling
SubPropertyOf: hasBloodrelation
Characteristics: Symmetric, transitive
SubPropertyChain: hasParent o isParentOf
</code></pre>
<p>We make a property of <code>hasSibling</code> and make it a sub-property of <code>hasBloodrelation</code>. Remember, think of the objects involved and the implications we want to follow; being a sibling implies being a blood relation, it does not imply any of the other relationships we have in the FHKB.</p>
<p>Note that we have made <code>hasSibling</code> symmetric; if Robert is sibling of Richard, then Richard is sibling of Robert. We should also think about transitivity; if David is sibling of Peter and Peter is sibling of John, then David is sibling of John. So, we make <code>hasSibling</code> symmetric and transitive (see Figure 5.1). However, we must take care of half-siblings: child 1 and child 2 share a mother, but not a father; child 2 and child 3 share the father, but not the mother – child 1 and child 3 are not even half-siblings. However, at least for the moment, we will simply ignore this inconvenience, largely so that we can explore what happens with different modelling options.</p>

<p>From this last DL query you should get the answer that both Robert and Richard are siblings of Robert. Think about the objects involved in the sub-property chain: we go from Robert to David via the <code>hasParent</code> and from David to Richard via the <code>isParentOf</code> property; so this is OK. However, we also go from Robert to David and then we can go from David back to Robert again – so Robert is a sibling of Robert. We do not want this to be true.</p>
<p><img alt="dragon" src="../../images/FHKB%20figures/dragon.png" /></p>

<p>Note that the reasoner claims you have an <em>inconsistent</em> ontology (or in some cases, you might get a message box saying "Reasoner died"). Looking at the <code>hasSibling</code> property again, the reason might not be immediately obvious. The reason for the inconsistency lies in the fact that we create a logical contradiction: through the property chain, we say that every <code>Person</code> is a sibling of him or herself, and again disallowing just that by adding the irreflexive characteristic. A different explanation lies within the OWL specification itself: In order to maintain decidability irreflexive properties must be simple - for example, they may not be property chains<sup>6</sup>.</p>

<p>We have only done siblings, but we obviously need to account for brothers and sisters. In an analogous way to motherhood, fatherhood and parenthood, we can talk about sex specific sibling relationships implying the sex neutral <code>hasSibling</code>; holding either a <code>hasBrother</code> or an <code>isSisterOf</code> between two objects would imply that a <code>hasSibling</code> property is also held between those two objects. This means that we can place these two sex specific sibling properties below <code>hasSibling</code> with ease. Note, however, that unlike the <code>hasSibling</code> property, the brother and sister properties are not symmetric. Robert <code>hasBrother</code> Richard and <em>vice versa</em> , but if Daisy <code>hasBrother</code> William, we do not want William to hold an <code>hasBrother</code> property with Daisy. Instead, we create an inverse of <code>hasBrother</code>, <code>isBrotherOf</code>, and the do the same for <code>isSisterOf</code>.</p>
<p>We use similar, object based, thought processes to choose whether to have transitivity as a characteristic of <code>hasBrother</code>. Think of some sibling objects or individuals and place <code>hasBrother</code> properties between them. Make it transitive and see if you get the right answers. Put in a sister to and see if it stil works. If David <code>hasBrother</code> Peter and Peter <code>hasBrother</code> John, then David <code>hasBrother</code> John; so, transitivity works in this case. Think of another example. Daisy <code>hasBrother</code> Frederick, and Frederick <code>hasBrother</code> William, thus Daisy <code>hasBrother</code> William. The inverses work in the same way; William <code>isBrotherOf</code> Frederick and Frederick <code>isBrotherOf</code> Daisy; thus William <code>isBrotherOf</code> Daisy. All this seems reasonable.</p>

<p>We have some <code>hasSibling</code> properties (even if they are wrong). We also know the sex of many of the people in the FHKB through the domains and ranges of properties such as <code>hasFather</code>, <code>hasMother</code> and their inverses..</p>
<p>Can we use sub-property chains in the same way as we have used them in the <code>hasSibling</code> property? The issue is that of sex; the property <code>isFatherOf</code> is sex neutral at the child end, as is the inverse <code>hasFather</code> (the same obviously goes for the mother properties). We could use a sub-property chain of the form:</p>
<pre><code>ObjectProperty: hasBrother
SubPropertyChain: hasParent o hasSon
</code></pre>
<p>A son is a male child and thus that object is a brother of his siblings. At the moment we do not have son or daughter properties. We can construct a property hierarchy as shown in Figure 5.3. This is made up from the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>hasChild</code> and <code>isChildOf</code></li>
<li><code>hasSon</code>(range <code>Man</code> and domain <code>Person</code>) and <code>isSonOf</code>;</li>
<li><code>hasDaughter</code>(range <code>Woman</code> domain <code>Person</code>) and <code>isDaughterOf</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that <code>hasChild</code> is the equivalent of the existing property <code>isParentOf</code>; if I have a child, then I am its
parent. OWL 2 can accommodate this fact. We can add an equivalent property axiom in the following
way:</p>
<pre><code>ObjectProperty: isChildOf
EquivalentTo: hasParent
</code></pre>
<p>We have no way of inferring the <code>isSonOf</code> and <code>isDaughterOf</code> from what already exists. What we want
to happen is the implication of ‘<code>Man</code> and <code>hasParent</code> <code>Person</code> implies <code>isSonOf</code>’. OWL 2 and its reasoners
cannot do this implication. It has been called the ‘man man problem’<sup>7</sup>. Solutions for this have been
developed [3], but are not part of OWL 2 and its reasoners.</p>

<p>Our option one has lots of problems. So, we have an option of asserting the various levels of sibling. We
can take the same basic structure of sibling properties as before, but just fiddle around a bit and rely on
more assertion while still trying to infer as much as possible. We will take the following approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will take off the sub-property chains of the sibling properties as they do not work;</li>
<li>We will assert the leaf properties of the sibling sub-hierarchy sparsely and attempt to infer as much
  as possible.</li>

<p>We can see some problems with this option as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>With these properties asserted, Richard only has a <code>hasBrother</code> property to Robert. We would really like an <code>isBrotherOf</code> to Robert to hold.</li>
<li>The query <code>Man</code> and <code>hasSibling value Robert</code> only retrieves Robert himself. Because we only asserted that Robert is a brother of Richard, and the domain of <code>isBrotherOf</code> is <code>Man</code> we know that Robert is a <code>Man</code>, but we do not know anything about the <code>Sex</code> of Richard.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="531-which-modelling-option-to-choose-for-siblings">5.3.1 Which Modelling Option to Choose for Siblings?<a class="headerlink" href="#531-which-modelling-option-to-choose-for-siblings" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Which of the two options gives the worse answers and which is the least effort? Option one is obviously the least effort; we only have to assert the same parentage facts as we already have; then the sub-property chains do the rest. It works OK for <code>hasSibling</code>, but we cannot do brothers and sisters adequately; we need <code>Man</code> and <code>hasSibling</code> ⊐ <code>isBrotherOf</code> and we cannot do that implication. This means we cannot ask the questions we need to ask.</p>
<p><img alt="dragon" src="../../images/FHKB%20figures/dragon.png" /></p>
<p>So, we do option two, even though it is hard work and is still not perfect for query answering, even though we have gone for a sparse assertion mode. Doing full sibling assertion would work, but is a lot of effort.</p>
<p>We could start again and use the <code>isSonOfandisDaughterOf</code> option, with the sub-property chains described above. This still has the problem of everyone being their own sibling. It can get the sex specific sibling relationships, but requires a wholesale re-assertion of parentage facts. We will continue with option two, largely because it highlights some nice problems later on.</p>
<h3 id="54-half-siblings">5.4 Half-Siblings<a class="headerlink" href="#54-half-siblings" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>In Section 5.2 we briefly talked about half-siblings. So far, we have assumed full-siblings (or, rather, just talked about siblings and made no distinction). Ideally, we would like to accommodate distinctions between full- and half-siblings; here we use half-siblings, where only one parent is in common between two individuals, as the example. The short-answer is, unfortunately, that OWL 2 cannot deal with half-siblings in the way that we want - that is, such that we can infer properties between named individuals indicating full- or half-sibling relationships.</p>
<p>It is possible to find sets of half-brothers in the FHKB by writing a defined class or DL-query for a particular individual.} The following fragment of OWL defines a class that looks for the half-brothers of an individual called ‘Percival’:</p>
<p><img alt="dragon" src="../../images/FHKB%20figures/dragon.png" /></p>
<pre><code>Class: HalfBrotherOfPercival
EquivalentTo: Man and (((hasFather some (not (isFatherOf value Percival))) and
(hasMother some (isMotherOf value Percival))) or ((hasFather some (isFatherOf
value Percival)) and (hasMother some (not (isMotherOf value Percival)))))
</code></pre>
<p>Here we are asking for any man that either has Percival’s father but not his mother, or his mother, but not his father. This works fine, but is obviously not a general solution. The OWL description is quite complex and the writing will not scale as the number of options (hypothetically, as the number of parents increases... ) increases; it is fine for man/woman, but go any higher and it will become very tedious to write all the combinations.</p>
<p>Another way of doing this half-brother class to find the set of half-brothers of a individual is to use cardinality constraints:</p>
<pre><code>Class: HalfBrotherOfPercival
EquivalentTo: Man and (hasParent exactly 1 (isParentOf value Percival))
</code></pre>
<p>This is more succinct. We are asking for a man that has exactly one parent from the class of individuals that are the class of Percival’s parents. This works, but one more constraint has to be present in the FHKB. We need to make sure that there can be only two parents (or indeed, just a specified number of parents for a person). If we leave it open as to the number of parents a person has, the reasoner cannot work out that there is a man that shares exactly one parent, as there may be other parents. We added this constraint to the FHKB in Section 6.2; try out the classes to check that they work.</p>
<p>These two solutions have been about finding sets of half-brothers for an individual. What we really want
in the FHKB is to find half-brothers between any given pair of individuals.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we cannot, without rules, ask OWL 2 to distinguish full- and half-siblings – we cannot
count the number of routes taken between siblings via different distinct intermediate parent objects.</p>
<h3 id="55-aunts-and-uncles">5.5 Aunts and Uncles<a class="headerlink" href="#55-aunts-and-uncles" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>An uncle is a brother of either my mother or father. An aunt is a sister of either my mother or father. In common practice, wives and husbands of aunts and uncles are usually uncles and aunts respectively. Formally, these aunts and uncles are aunts-in-law and uncles-in-law. Whatever approach we take, we cannot fully account for aunts and uncles until we have information about marriages, which will not have until Chapter 9. We will, however, do the first part now.</p>
<p>Look at the objects and properties between them for the following facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Robert has father David and mother Margaret;</li>
<li>David has brothers Peter and John;</li>
<li>Margaret has a sister Eileen;</li>
<li>Robert thus has the uncles John and Peter and an aunt Eileen.</li>
</ul>
<p>As we are tracing paths or ‘chains’ of objects and properties we should use sub-property chains as a solution for the aunts and uncles. We can make an <code>hasUncle</code> property as follows (see Figure 5.4):</p>
<pre><code>ObjectProperty: hasUncle
SubPropertyOf: hasBloodrelation
Domain: Man
Range: Person
SubPropertyChain: hasParent o hasBrother
InverseOf: isUncleOf
</code></pre>
<p><img alt="Figure 5.4" src="../../images/FHKB%20figures/uncle.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 5.4:</strong> Tracing out the path between objects to get the <code>hasUncle</code> sub-property chain.</p>
<p>Notice we have the domain of <code>Man</code> and range of <code>Person</code>. We also have an inverse. As usual, we can read this as ‘an object that holds an <code>hasParent</code> property, followed by an object holding a <code>hasBrother</code> property, implies that the first object holds an <code>hasUncle</code> property with the last object’.</p>
<p>Note also where the properties (include the ones for aunt) go in the object property hierarchy. Aunts and uncles are not ancestors that are in the direct blood line of a person, but they are blood relations (in the narrower definition that we are using). Thus the aunt and uncle properties go under the <code>hasBloodrelation</code> property (see Figure 5.5). Again, think of the implications between objects holding a property between them; that two objects linked by a property implies that those two objects also hold all the property’s super-properties as well. As long as all the super-properties are true, the place in the object property hierarchy is correct (think about the implications going up, rather than down).</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 5.5" src="../../images/FHKB%20figures/new/prop_uncle.PNG" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 5.5:</strong> The object property hierarchy with the aunt and uncle properties included. On the right side, we
can see the hasUncle property as shown by Protégé.</p>
<p>Do the following tasks:</p>

</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><ol><li>Add the <code>hasUncle</code> property as above; </li><li> Add the <code>hasAunt</code> property as well; </li><li> Ask for the uncles of <code>Julie_Bright_1966</code> and for <code>Mark_Bright_1956</code>; </li><li> Add similar properties for <code>hasGreatUncle</code> and <code>hasGreatAunt</code> and place them in the property hierarchy.</li></ol></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>We can see this works – unless we have any gaps in the sibling relationships (you may have to fix these). Great aunts and uncles are simply a matter of adding another ‘parent’ leg into the sub-property chain. We are not really learning anything new with aunts and uncles, except that we keep gaining a lot for</p>
<p>free through sub-property chains. We just add a new property with its sub-property chain and we get a whole lot more inferences on individuals. To see what we now know about Robert David Bright, do the following:</p>

<p>So far we have only used object properties between unspecified objects. We can, however, specify a specific individual to act at the right-hand-side of a class restriction or type assertion on an individual. The basic syntax for so-called <em>nominals</em> is:</p>
<pre><code>Class: ParentOfRobert
EquivalentTo: Person and isParentOf valueRobert_David_Bright_1965
</code></pre>
<p>This is an equivalence axiom that recognises any individual that is a <code>Person</code> and a parent of Robert David Bright.</p>

<p>We see that these queries work and that we can create more complex nominal based class expressions. The disjunction above is</p>
<pre><code>isParentOf some {Robert_David_Bright_1965, Richard_John_Bright_1965}
</code></pre>
<p>The ‘{’ and ‘}’ are a bit of syntax that says ‘here’s a class of individual’.</p>
<p>We also see that the classes for the parents of Robert David Bright and Richard John Bright have the same members according to the FHKB, but that the two classes are not inferred to be equivalent. Our domain knowledge indicates the two classes have the same extents (members) and thus the classes are equivalent, but the automated reasoner does not make this inference. As usual, this is because the FHKB has not given the automated reasoner enough information to make such an inference.</p>
<h3 id="62-closing-down-what-we-know-about-parents-and-siblings">6.2 Closing Down What we Know About Parents and Siblings<a class="headerlink" href="#62-closing-down-what-we-know-about-parents-and-siblings" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The classes describing the parents of Richard and Robert are not equivalent, even though, as humans, we know their classes of parent are the same. We need more constraints so that it is known that the four parents are the only ones that exist. We can try this by closing down what we know about the immediate family of Robert David Bright.</p>
<p>In Chapter 4 we described that a <code>Person</code> has exactly one <code>Woman</code> and exactly one <code>Man</code> as mother and father (by saying that the <code>hasMother</code> and <code>hasFather</code> properties are functional and thus only one of each may be held by any one individual to distinct individuals). The parent properties are defined in terms of <code>hasParent</code>, <code>hasMother</code> and <code>hasFather</code>. The latter two imply <code>hasParent</code>. The two sub-properties are functional, but there are no constraints on <code>hasParent</code>, so an individual can hold many instances of this property. So, there is no information in the FHKB to say a <code>Person</code> has only two parents (we say there is one mother and one father, but not that there are only two parents). Thus Robert and Richard could have other parents and other grandparents than those in the FHKB; we have to close down our descriptions so that only two parents are possible. There are two ways of doing this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using qualified cardinality constraints in a class restriction;</li>
<li>Putting a covering axiom on <code>hasParent</code> in the same way as we did for <code>Sex</code> in Chapter 4.</li>
</ol>

<p><img alt="dragon" src="../../images/FHKB%20figures/dragon.png" /></p>
<p>We find that these two classes are equivalent; we have supplied enough information to infer that these two classes are equivalent. So, we know that option one above works, but what about option two? This takes a bit of care to think through, but the basic thing is to think about how many ways there are to have a <code>hasParent</code> relationship between two individuals. We know that we can have either a <code>hasFather</code> or a <code>hasMother</code> property between two individuals; we also know that we can have only one of each of these properties between an individual and a distinct individual. However, the open world assumption tells us that there may be other ways of having a <code>hasParent</code> property between two individuals; we’ve not closed the possibilities. By putting on the <code>hasParent exactly 2 Person</code> restriction on the <code>Person</code> class, we are effectively closing down the options for ways that a person can have parents; we know because of the functional characteristic on <code>hasMother</code> and <code>hasFather</code> that we can have only one of each of these and the two restrictions say that one of each must exist. So, we know we have two ways of having a parent on each <code>Person</code> individual. So, when we say that there are exactly two parents (no more and no less) we have closed down the world of having parents—thus these two classes can be inferred to be equivalent. It is also worth noting that this extra axiom on the <code>Person</code> class will make the reasoner run much more slowly.</p>
<p>Finally, for option 2, we have no way of placing a covering axiom on a property. What we’d like to be
able to state is something like:</p>
<pre><code>ObjectProperty: hasParent
EquivalentTo: hasFather or hasMother
</code></pre>
<p>but we can’t.</p>

<p>In this chapter we have seen the use of individuals within class expressions. It allows us to make useful queries and class definitions. The main things to note is that it can be done and that there is some syntax involved. More importantly, some inferences may not be as expected due to the open world assumption in OWL.</p>

us most of what we need, but has a little less negative impact on the reasoning

<p>Everyone has a birth year; death year; and some have a marriage year and so on. We can model these simply with data properties and an integer as a filler. OWL 2 has a DateTime datatype, where it is possible to specify a precise time and date down to a second. <sup>7</sup> This proves cumbersome (see http://robertdavidstevens.wordpress.com/2011/05/05/using-the-datetime-data-type-to-describe-birthdays/ for details); all we need is a simple indication of the year in which a person was born. Of course, the integer type has a zero, which the Gregorian calendar for which we use integer as a proxy does not, but integer is sufficient to our needs. Also, there are various ontological treatments of time and information about people (this extends to names etc. as well), but we gloss over that here—that’s another tutorial.</p>

<p>The last two queries in the list do not work as expected. We have asked, for instance, for <code>Person</code> that have more than three children, but we get no members of <code>Person</code> in the answer, though we know that there are some in the FHKB (e.g., <code>John_Bright_1930</code>). This is because there is not enough information in the FHKB to tell that this person has more than three <strong>different</strong> people as children. As humans we can look at the four children of John Bright and know that they are different – for instance, they all have different birth years. The automated reasoner, however, does not know that a <code>Person</code> can only have one birth year.</p>

<p>This time the query should work. All the other event year properties should be made functional, expect <code>hasEventYear</code>, as one individual can have many event years. As the children have different birth year and an individual can only hold one <code>hasBirthYear</code> property, then these people must be distinct entities.</p>
<p>Of course, making birth year functional is not a reliable way of ensuring that the automated reasoner knows that the individual are different. It is possible for two <code>Person</code> to have the same birth year within the same family – twins and so on. <code>Peter_William_Bright_1941</code> has three children, two of which are twins, so will not be a member of the class of people with at least three children. So, we use the <strong>different individuals</strong> axiom. Most tools, including Protégé, have a feature that allows all individuals to be made different.</p>

<h3 id="72-the-open-world-assumption">7.2 The Open World Assumption<a class="headerlink" href="#72-the-open-world-assumption" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>We have met again the open world assumption and its importance in the FHKB. In the use of the functional characteristic on the <code>hasBirthYear</code> property, we saw one way of constraining the interpretation of numbers of children. We also introduced the ‘different individuals’ axiom as a way of making all individuals in a knowledge base distinct. There are more questions, however, for which we need more ways of closing down the openness of OWL 2.</p>
<p>Take the questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>People that have exactly two children;</li>
<li>People that have only brothers;</li>
<li>People that have only female children.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="dragon" src="../../images/FHKB%20figures/dragon.png" /></p>
<p>We can only answer these questions if we locally close the world.We have said that David and Margaret have two children, Richard and Robert, but we have not said that there are not any others. As usual, try not to apply your domain knowledge too much; ask yourself what the automated reasoner actually knows. As we have the open world assumption, the reasoner will assume, unless otherwise said, that there could be more children; it simply doesn’t know.</p>
<p>Think of a railway journey enquiry system. If I ask a standard closed world system about the possible routes by rail, between Manchester and Buenos Aires, the answer will be ’none’, as there are none described in the system. With the open world assumption, if there is no information in the system then the answer to the same question will simply be ‘I don’t know’. We have to explicitly say that there is no railway route from Manchester to Buenos Aires for the right answer to come back.</p>
<p>We have to do the same thing in OWL. We have to say that David and Margaret have only two children. We do this with a <strong>type assertion</strong> on individuals. So far we have only used fact assertions. A type assertion to close down David Bright’ parentage looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>isParentOf only {Robert_David_Bright_1965,Richard_John_Bright_1962 }
</code></pre>
<p><img alt="dragon" src="../../images/FHKB%20figures/dragon.png" /></p>
<p>This has the same meaning as the closure axioms that you should be familiar with on classes. We are saying that the only fillers that can appear on the right-hand-side of the <code>isParentOf</code> property on this individual are the two individuals for Richard and Robert. We use the braces to represent the set of these two individuals.</p>

<p>The last query should return the answer of David Bright. Closing down the whole FHKB ABox is a chore and would really have to be done programmatically.

<p>We also want to add some other useful data facts to people – their names. We have been putting names as part of labels on individuals, but data fact assertions make sense to separate out family and given names so that we can ask questions such as ‘give me all people with the family name Bright and the first given name of either James or William’. A person’s name is a fact about that person and is more, in this case, than just a label of the representation of that person. So, we want family names and given names. A person may have more than one given name – ‘Robert David’, for instance – and an arbitrary number of given names can be held. For the FHKB, we have simply created two data properties of <code>hasFirstGivenName</code> and <code>hasSecondGivenName</code>). Ideally, it would be good to have some index on the property to given name position, but OWL has no n-ary relationships. Otherwise, we could reify the <code>hasGivenName</code> property into a class of objects, such as the following:</p>
<pre><code>Class: GivenName
SubClassOf:hasValue some String,
hasPosition some Integer
</code></pre>
<p>but it is really rather too much trouble for the resulting query potential.</p>
<p>As already shown, we will use data properties relating instances of <code>Person</code> to strings. We want to distinguish family and given names, and then different positions of given names through simple conflating of position into the property name. Figure 7.1 shows the intended data property hierarchy.</p>

<p>The name data property hierarchy and the queries using those properties displays what now should be familiar. Sub-properties that imply the super-property. So, when we ask <code>hasFirstGivenName</code> value <code>"William"</code> and then the query <code>hasGivenName value value "William"</code> we can expect different answers. There are people with ‘William’ as either first or second given name and asking the question with the super-property for given names will collect both first and second given names.</p>
<h3 id="74-summary">7.4 Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#74-summary" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>We have used data properties that link objects to data such as string, integer, floats and Booleans etc. OWL uses the XML data types. We have seen a simple use of data properties to simulate birth years. The full FHKB also uses them to place names (given and family) on individuals as strings. This means one can ask for the <code>Person</code> with the given name "James", of which there are many in the FHKB.</p>
<p>Most importantly we have re-visited the open world assumption and its implications for querying an OWL ABox. We have looked at ways in which the ABox can be closed down – unreliably via the functional characteristic (in this particular case) and more generally via type assertions.</p>
<p>All the DL queries used in this chapter can also serve as defined classes in the TBox. It is a useful exercise to progressively add more defined classes to the FHKB TBox. Make more complex queries, make them into defined classes and inspect where they appear in the class hierarchy.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 8.1:</strong> Tracing out the sub-property chain for cousins going from a child to a parent, to its sibling, and
down to its child, a cousin</p>
<p>Figure 8.1 shows the sub-property chain for first cousins. As usual, think at the object level; to get to the first cousins of Robert David Bright, we go to the parents of Robert David Bright, to their siblings and then to their children. We go up, along and down. The OWL for this could be:</p>
<pre><code>ObjectProperty: hasFirstCousin
SubPropertyOf: hasCousin
SubPropertyChain: hasParent o hasSibling o hasChild
Characteristics: Symmetric
</code></pre>
<p>Note that we follow the definitions in Section 8.1 of first cousins sharing a grandparent, but not a parent. The sub-property chain goes up to children of a grandparent (a given person’s parents), along to siblings and down to their children. We do not want this property to be transitive. One’s cousins are not necessarily my cousins. The blood uncles of Robert David Bright have children that are his cousins. These first cousins, however, also have a mother that is not a blood relation of Robert David Bright and the mother’s sibling’s children are not cousins of Robert David Bright.</p>
<p>We do, however, want the property to be symmetric. One’s cousins have one’s-self as a cousin.</p>
<p>We need to place the cousin properties in the growing object property hierarchy. Cousins are obviously blood relations, but not ancestors, so they go off to one side, underneath <code>hasBloodrelation</code>. We should group the different removes and degree of cousin underneath one <code>hasCousin</code> property and this we will do.</p>
<p>Do the following:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Task 33: First cousins</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><ol><li>Add the property of <code>hasCousin</code> to the hierarchy underneath <code>hasBloodrelation</code>;</li><li>Add <code>hasFirstCousin</code> underneath this property;</li><li>Add the sub-property chain as described above;</li><li>Run the reasoner and look at the first cousins of Robert David Bright.</li><ol></td>

<p>You should see the following people as first cousins of Robert David Bright: Mark Anthony Heath,
Nicholas Charles Heath, Mark Bright, Ian Bright, Janet Bright, William Bright, James Bright, Julie
Bright, Clare Bright, Richard John Bright and Robert David Bright. The last two, as should be expected,
are first cousins of Robert David Bright and this is not correct. As David Bright will be his own brother,
his children are his own nieces and nephews and thus the cousins of his own children. Our inability to
infer siblings correctly in the FHKB haunts us still and will continue to do so.</p>
<p><img alt="dragon" src="../../images/FHKB%20figures/dragon.png" /></p>

<p>Other degrees of cousins follow the same pattern as for first cousins; we go up, along and down. For second cousins we go up from a given individual to children of a great grandparent, along to their siblings and down to their grandchildren. The following object property declaration is for second cousins (note it uses the <code>isGrandparentOf</code> and its inverse properties, though the parent properties could be used) :</p>
<pre><code>ObjectProperty: hasSecondCousin
SubPropertyOf: hasCousin
SubPropertyChain: hasGrandParent o hasSibling o isGrandParentOf
Characteristics: Symmetric
</code></pre>
<p>‘ <em>Removes</em> ’ simply add in another ‘leg’ of either ‘up’ or ‘down’ either side of the ‘along’—that is, think of the actual individuals involved and draw a little picture of blobs and lines—then trace your finger up, along and down to work out the sub-property chain. The following object property declaration does it for first cousins once removed (note that this has been done by putting this extra ‘leg’ on to the <code>hasFirstCousin</code> property; the symmetry of the property makes it work either way around so that a given person is the first cousin once removed of his/her first cousins once removed):</p>
<pre><code>ObjectProperty: hasFirstCousinOnceRemoved
SubPropertyOf: hasCousin
SubPropertyChain: hasFirstCousin o hasChild
Characteristics: Symmetric

<p>To exercise the cousin properties do the following:</p>

<p>You should see that we see some peculiar inferences about Robert David Bright’ cousins – not only are his brother and himself his own cousins, but so are his father, mother, uncles and so on. This makes sense if we look at the general sibling problem, but also it helps to just trace the paths around. If we go up from one of Robert David Bright’ true first cousins to a grandparent and down one parent relationship, we follow the first cousin once removed path and get to one of Robert David Bright’ parents or uncles. This is not to be expected and we need a tighter definition that goes beyond sub-property chains so that we can exclude some implications from the FHKB.</p>
<h3 id="84-doing-first-cousins-properly">8.4 Doing First Cousins Properly<a class="headerlink" href="#84-doing-first-cousins-properly" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>As far as inferring first cousin facts for Robert David Bright, we have failed. More precisely, we have recalled all Robert David Bright’s cousins, but the precision is not what we would desire. What we can do is ask for Robert David Bright’ cousins, but then remove the children of Robert David Bright’ parents. The following DL query achieves this:</p>
<pre><code>Person that hasFirstCousin valueRobert_David_Bright_1965
and (not (hasFather valueDavid_Bright_1934) or not (hasMother valueMar-
garet_Grace_Rever_1934)
</code></pre>
<p>This works, but only for a named individual. We could make a defined class for this query; we could also make a defined class <code>FirstCousin</code>, but it is not of much utility. We would have to make sure that people whose parents are not known to have siblings with children are excluded. That is, people are not ‘first cousins’ whose only first cousins are themselves and their siblings. The following class does this:</p>
<pre><code>Class: FirstCousin

<p>We have now expanded the FHKB to include most blood relationships. We have also found that cousins are hard to capture just using object properties and sub-property chains. Our broken sibling inferences mean that we have too many cousins inferred at the instance level. We can get cousins right at the class level by using our inference based cousins, then excluding some using negation. Perhaps not neat, but it works.</p>
<p>We have reinforced that we can just add more and more relationships to individuals by just adding more properties to our FHKB object property hierarchy and adding more sub-property chains that use the object properties we have built up upon parentage and sibling properties; this is as it should be.</p>

<p>Marriage is a culturally complex situation to model. The FHKB started with a conservative model of a marriage involving only one man and one woman.<sup>10</sup> Later versions are more permissive; a marriage simply has a minimum of two partners. This leaves it open to numbers and sex of the people involved. In fact, ‘marriage’ is probably not the right name for it. Using <code>BreedingRelationship</code> as a label (the one favoured by the main author’s mother) may be a little too stark and might be a little exclusive.... In any case, some more generic name is probably better and various subclasses of the FHKB’s <code>Marriage</code> class are probably necessary.</p>

<p>Now we have spouses, we can also have in-laws. The path is simple: <code>isSpouseOf o hasMother</code> implies <code>hasMotherInLaw</code>. The path involved in mother-in-laws can be seen in Figure 9.2. The following OWL code establishes the sub-property chains for <code>hasMotherInLaw</code>:</p>
<pre><code>ObjectProperty: hasMotherInLaw
SubPropertyOf: hasParentInLaw
SubPropertyChain: isSpouseOf o hasMother
Domain: Person
Range: Woman
InverseOf: isMotherInLawOf

<p>Brothers and sisters in law have the interesting addition of having more than one path between objects to establish a sister or brother in law relationship. The OWL code below establishes the relationships for ‘is sister in law of’:</p>
<pre><code>ObjectProperty: hasSisterInLaw
SubPropertyOf: hasSiblingInLaw
SubPropertyChain: hasSpouse o hasSister
SubPropertyChain: hasSibling o isWifeOf
</code></pre>
<p>A wife’s husband’s sister is a sister in law of the wife. Figure 9.3 shows the two routes to being a sister-in-law. In addition, the wife is a sister in law of the husband’s siblings. One can add as many sub-property chains to a property as one needs. You should add the properties for <code>hasSiblingInLawOf</code> and its obvious sub-properties following the inverse of the pattern above.</p>

<p>This has really been a revision chapter; nothing new has really been introduced. We have added a lot of new object properties and one new data property. The latest object property hierarchy with the ‘in-law’ branch can be seen in Figure 9.4. Highlights have been:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having an explicit marriage object so that we can say things about the marriage itself, not just the people in the marriage;</li>
<li>We have seen that more than one property chain can be added to a property;</li>
<li>We have added a lot of kith relationships to join the kin or blood relationships;</li>
<li>As usual, the reasoner can establish the hierarchy for the inverses and put a lot of the domain and ranges in for free.</li>

<p>The three classes of <code>Child</code>, <code>Son</code> and <code>Daughter</code> are of note. They are coded in the following way:</p>
<pre><code>Class: Child EquivalentTo: Person that hasParent Some Person
Class: Son EquivalentTo: Man that hasParent Some Person
Class: Daughter EquivalentTo: Woman that hasParent Some Person
</code></pre>
<p>After running the reasoner, you will find that <code>Person</code> is found to be equivalent to <code>Child</code>; <code>Daughter</code> is equivalent to <code>Woman</code> and that <code>Son</code> is equivalent to <code>Man</code>. This does, of course, make sense – each and every person is someone’s child, each and every woman is someone’s daughter. We will forget evolutionary time-scales where this might be thought to break down at some point – all <code>Person</code> individuals are also <code>Descendant</code> individuals, but do we expect some molecule in some prebiotic soup to be a member of this class?</p>
<p>Nevertheless, within the scope of the FHKB, such inferred equivalences are not unreasonable. They are
also instructive; it is possible to have different intentional descriptions of a class and for them to have the
same logical extents. You can see another example of this happening in the amino acids ontology, but
for different reasons.</p>
<p>Taking <code>Grandparent</code> as an example class, there are two ways of writing the defined class:</p>
<pre><code>Class: Grandparent EquivalentTo: Person and isGrandparentOf some Person
Class: Grandparent EquivalentTo: Person and (isParentOf some (Person and (is-
ParentOf some Person))
</code></pre>
<p>Each comes out at a different place in the class hierarchy. They both capture the right individuals as members (that is, those individuals in the ABox that are holding a <code>isGrandparentOf</code> property), but the class hierarchy is not correct. By definition, all grandparents are also parents, but the way the object property hierarchy works means that the first way of writing the defined class (with the <code>isGrandparentOf</code> property) is not subsumed by the class <code>Parent</code>. We want this to happen in any sensible class hierarchy, so we have to use the second pattern for all the classes, spelling out the sub-property path that implies the property such as <code>isGrandparentOf</code> within the equivalence axiom.</p>
<p>The reason for this need for the ‘long-form’ is that the <code>isGrandparentOf</code> does not imply the <code>isParentOf</code> property. As described in Chapter 3 if this implication were the case, being a grandparent of Robert David Bright, for instance, would also imply that the same <code>Person</code> were a parent of Robert David Bright; an implication we do not want. As these two properties (<code>isParentOf</code> and <code>isGrandparentOf</code>) do not subsume each other means that the defined classes written according to pattern one above will not subsume each other in the class hierarchy. Thus we use the second pattern. If we look at the class for grandparents of Robert:</p>
<pre><code>Class: GrandparentOfRobert
EquivalentTo: Person that isParentOf some (Person that isParentOf value Robert
David Bright)
</code></pre>
<p>If we make the equivalent class for Richard John Bright, apply the reasoner and look at the hierarchy, we see that the two classes are not logically equivalent, even though they have the same extents of William George Bright, Iris Ellen Archer, Charles Herbert Rever and Violet Sylvia Steward. We looked at this example in Section 6.2, where there is an explanation and solutions.</p>
<h3 id="102-summary">10.2 Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#102-summary" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>We can add defined classes based on each property we have put into the object property hierarchy. We see the expected hierarchy; as can be seen from Figure 10.1 it has an obvious symmetry based on sex. We also see a lot of equivalences inferred – all women are daughters, as well as women descendants. Perhaps not the greatest insight ever gained, but it at least makes sense; all women must be daughters. It is instructive to use the explanation feature in Protégé to look at why the reasoner has made these inferences. For example, take a look at the class <code>hasGrandmother some Woman</code> – it is instructive to see how many there are.</p>
<p>Like the Chapter on marriage and in-law (Chapter 9), this chapter has largely been revision. One thing of note is, however, that we must not use the object properties that are inferred through sub-property chains as definitions in the TBox; we must spell out the sub-property chain in the definition, otherwise the implications do not work properly.</p>
<p>One thing is almost certain; the resulting TBox is rather complex and would be almost impossible to maintain by hand.</p>

<p>If you have done all the tasks within this tutorial, then you will have touched most parts of OWL 2. Unusually for most uses of OWL we have concentrated on individuals, rather than just on the TBox. One note of warning – the full FHKB has some 450 members of the Bright family and takes a reasonably long time to classify, even on a sensible machine. The FHKB is not scalable in its current form.</p>
<p>One reason for this is that we have deliberately maximised inference. We have attempted not to explicitly type the individuals, but drive that through domain and range constraints. We are making the property hierarchy do lots of work. For the individual Robert David Bright, we only have a couple of assertions, but we infer some 1 500 facts between Robert David Bright and other named individuals in the FHKB–displaying this in Protégé causes problems. We have various complex classes in the TBox and so on.</p>
<p><img alt="dragon" src="../../images/FHKB%20figures/dragon.png" /></p>
<p>We probably do not wish to drive a genealogical application using an FHKB in this form. Its purpose is educational. It touches most of OWL 2 and shows a lot of what it can do, but also a considerable amount of what it cannot do. As inference is maximised, the FHKB breaks most of the OWL 2 reasoners at the time of writing.However, it serves its role to teach about OWL 2.</p>
<p>OWL 2 on its own and using it in this style, really does not work for family history. We have seen that siblings and cousins cause problems. rules in various forms can do this kind of thing easily—it is one of the primary examples for learning about Prolog. Nevertheless, the FHKB does show how much inference between named individuals can be driven from a few fact assertions and a property hierarchy. Assuming a powerful enough reasoner and the ability to deal with many individuals, it would be possible to make a family history application using the FHKB; as long as one hid the long and sometimes complex queries and manipulations that would be necessary to ‘prune’ some of the ‘extra’ facts found about individuals. However, the FHKB does usefully show the power of OWL 2, touch a great deal of the language and demonstrate some of its limitations.</p>
